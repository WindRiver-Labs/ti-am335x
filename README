        TI AM335x-EVM/SK and BeagleBoneBlack Boards


1. About this document
======================
This document describes the common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River Linux
and the wr-kernel layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the ti-am335x layer
----------------------------
This layer and wr-kernel layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This
is done automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

2. BSP Kernel and Distros
=========================

The following table summarizes the valid Wind River Linux distros for this BSP.
'Y' in each content cell stands for supported; 'N' stands for not supported:

  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+
  | valid/distro |   wrlinux   | wrlinux-cgl | wrlinux-std-sato |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+
  |    valid     |      Y      |      N      |        Y         |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES"'.

Note: The preempt-rt ktype is not available for this BSP/Machine at this time.


3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

	# cd path_to_project/tmp-glibc/work-shared/ti-am335x/kernel-source
	# git whatchanged standard/base..HEAD


4. Boot Instructions
====================

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Configure u-boot with target IP, tftp server, netmask and other required
network values.
 > tftp    0x82000000 "/<tftp root>/zImage"
 > tftp    0x80005000 "/<tftp root>/dtb"
 > setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/nfs rw \
          nfsroot=<nfs server>:<nfs root>,nolock ip=dhcp\
          ip=<target IP>::<gateway>:<netmask>::eth0:off
 > bootz 0x82000000 - 0x80005000

 or use the env variable:
 > set serverip $addr
 > set ipaddr   $addr
 > set netargs setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200n8 root=/dev/nfs \
                      nfsroot=<IP>:<nfs_dir>,nolock rw ip=dhcp;
 > setenv autoload no;run netargs;
 > bootz 0x82000000 - 0x80005000

4.2 Rootfs on MMC/SD
--------------------

An ext4 filesystem can be created on the MMC/SD using standard techniques.

4.2.1 Deployment
----------------

After loading the kernel, pass kernel arguments like following:

    root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw console=ttyS0,115200n8 rootwait

4.2.2 Note
----------

Please set the right /dev/mmcblkXpX according to your real app scenario, then
rootfs will be correctly mounted.

5. WIC Notes
============

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator to create the properly partitioned
image on a SD card. It generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded
build artifacts. Please refer to the following URL for more detailed partition
information about WIC:

https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

After having built your project, a partitioned WIC image will be created in the
deploy folder as follows:

  path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/ti-am335x/wrlinux-image-glibc-<rootfs_type>-ti-am335x.wic

There are two partitions in this WIC images, the first one is to hold the boot
images, the second is the related root file system.

5.1 An example to deploy bootloader into the first partition
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Deploy the created WIC image into SD card(/dev/sdx) in your host machine.

   $ sudo dd if=wrlinux-image-glibc-<rootfs_type>-ti-am335x.wic of=/dev/sdx

2) Deploy your own MLO and u-boot.img into this /dev/sdx1

   $ sudo mount /dev/sdx1 path_to_sdx1
   $ cp -r path_to_your_bootloader/MLO path_to_sdx1
   $ cp -r path_to_your_bootloader/u-boot.img path_to_sdx1
   $ sync; sudo umount path_to_sdx1

5.2 Boot the board from the WIC SD card

---------------------------------------
Insert the SD card into the board and select this SD card as the boot device.
Then set the proper u-boot environment parameters to boot the board like the
following steps:

   $ setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait ip=dhcp
   $ fatload mmc 0 0x82000000 zImage; fatload mmc 0 0x80005000 am335x-boneblack.dtb; bootz 0x82000000 - 0x80005000
